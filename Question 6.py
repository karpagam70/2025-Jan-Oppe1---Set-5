Find Minimum Card of a Specific Suit in Hand
Write a function find_min_card that takes a list of string representations of playing cards and a string representing a suit, and returns the minimum card of that suit based on the standard card ranking. If there are no cards of that suit, return None. If the input list is empty, return None.

The cards are represented in the following format:

The first character represents the suit:
'S' for Spades
'H' for Hearts
'C' for Clubs
'D' for Diamonds
The second character(s) represent the rank:
'2' through '10' for numbered cards
'J' for Jack
'Q' for Queen
'K' for King
'A' for Ace
The ranking of cards from lowest to highest in a standard deck of cards is:

2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A
Example

>>> find_min_card(['H2', 'S9', 'DA', 'C5', 'CA'], 'S')
'S9'
>>> find_min_card(['H2', 'DA', 'C5', 'CA'], 'H')
'H2'
>>> find_min_card(['DA', 'C5', 'CA'], 'C')
'C5'
>>> find_min_card(['H10', 'D4'], 'S')
