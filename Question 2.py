Get Next Roll Number
Write a function next_roll_no that takes a roll number roll_no as input and returns the next roll number in sequence within the same year and term.

The roll number format is {yy}f{t}{num}, where:

{yy} represents the two-digit year
f is a fixed character
{t} represents the term number (1, 2, or 3)
{num} is a six-digit number padded with zeros on the left
Assume the num part of the roll number will be less than 999999.

Example

next_roll_no("23f2000001") -> '23f2000002'
next_roll_no("24f3099999") -> '24f3100000'
