'''
Check If a String has No Vowels in Even Indices
Write a function has_no_vowels_in_even_indices that takes a string s as input and returns True if there are no vowels in the even indices of the string, otherwise returns False.

NOTE: This is a function type question, you don't have to take input or print the output, just have to complete the required function definition.

Examples

>>> has_no_vowels_in_even_indices("babebibobu") # The vowels are present in odd indices
True
>>> has_no_vowels_in_even_indices("abcde") # a is present in even index 0
False
>>> has_no_vowels_in_even_indices("test") # only vowel e is present in odd index 1
True 
>>> has_no_vowels_in_even_indices("why") # no vowels
True
