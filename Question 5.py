The range in the range-type question is given in the format {low}..{high}.

The choice type answer is correct if both the answer given and the student's answer are same.
The range type answer is correct if low<=student_anser<=high.

4
choice a b
range 1..4 3
choice b b
range 1.1..4.5 5
Output

5
2

choice a b	No	-1	-1	0
range 1..4 3	Yes	3	2	1
choice b b	Yes	3	5	2
range 1.1..4.5 5	No	0	5	2
